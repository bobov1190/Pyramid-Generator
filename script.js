/* Step 1
In this project, you will learn the basics of Javascript and apply those concepts to building a pyramid generator.

A pyramid generator is a program where you can set the type of character, the count for the pyramid, and the direction of the pyramid. The program will then generate a pyramid based on those inputs.

console.log("Let's build a pyramid using JavaScript basics:")
console.log('    #    ')
console.log('   ###   ')
console.log('  #####  ')
console.log(' ####### ')
console.log('#########')

/* Step 2
Use the let keyword to declare a variable called character.

Note: It is common practice to end statements in JavaScript with a semicolon. ;

let character
*/

/* Step 3
Assigning a value to a variable at the moment of its declaration is known as initialization.

Initialize your character variable by assigning it the value "Hello" during its declaration.
*/

/* Step 4
JavaScript has seven primitive data types, with String being one of them. In JavaScript, a string represents a sequence of characters and can be enclosed in either single (') or double (") quotes.*Note that strings are immutable, which means once they are created, they cannot be changed. The variable can still be reassigned another value.
*/

/* Step 5
The console allows you to print and view JavaScript output. You can send information to the console using console.log().
*/

/* Step 6
When a variable is declared with the let keyword, you can reassign (or change the value of) that variable later on.
Note that when reassigning a variable, you do not use the let keyword again.
*/

/* Step 7
Just a console.log()
*/

/* Step 8
When variable names are more than one word, there are specific naming conventions for how you capitalize the words. In JavaScript, the convention to use is camel case.
Camel case means that the first word in the name is entirely lowercase, but the following words are all title-cased. Here are some examples of camel case
